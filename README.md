[MAKAHO](https://makaho.sk8.inrae.fr/) is a [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) website based on [ashes](https://github.com/super-lou/ashes) and [AoTre](https://github.com/vmansanarez/AoTre) packages. Its main objective is to provide an interactive cartographic solution to analyze the hydrological stationarity of French surface flows based on the data of the hydrometric stations where the flows are little influenced by the human actions.</br>

Data came from [Hydroportail](https://www.hydro.eaufrance.fr/) and the selection of stations follows the [Reference Network for Low Water Monitoring (Réseau de référence pour la surveillance des étiages, RRSE in french)](https://geo.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/29819c27c73f29ee1a962450da7c2d49f6e11c15).</br>

This project was carried out for [National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (Institut National de Recherche pour l’Agriculture, l’Alimentation et l’Environnement, INRAE in french)](https://agriculture.gouv.fr/inrae-linstitut-national-de-recherche-pour-lagriculture-lalimentation-et-lenvironnement).
