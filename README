README
	Sht is a toolbox of R code that perfoms 

	The plan of a first use is developed below :

	1. In order to manage to use this code, you firstly need to
	install R (more info here : https://www.r-project.org) but
	also for R studio if you want a user-friendly text editor
	(more info here : https://www.rstudio.com/).

	contact us. Contact first Louis HÃ©raut who is the main
	developer. If it is not possible, Michel Lang is the main
	referent at INRAE to contact :
	

GIT
	To download the very latest source off the GIT server do this:
	git clone https://gitlab.irstea.fr/louis.heraut/sht.git

	(you will get a directory named sht created, filled with the
	source code)


NOTICE
	Feel free to use all the code or only some parts but it would
	be nice to at least mention the name of the authors.
	
	Sht stand for "Shiny Hydrological Tendency".
